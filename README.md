# Sorting Algorithms
I am testing the counting and radix sorting algorithms against merge sort to test the situations
in which I can break O(n log n) running.  The counting and radix sort are borrowed from the following repo:

https://github.com/gwtw/ruby-sorting/tree/master/lib

Mergesort was copied from the Java implementation from the Algorithms 4th edition text.
